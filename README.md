### Selene Server

You may also wish to run the [Selene Server](https://git.xulu.tech/selene.cash/selene-server) locally for statistics and other features, but the production server is fine for most purposes.

If you are running Selene Server locally, make sure to update the server URL in `src/apolloClient.tsx`.

## Dev Notes

### For merging from PRs to mirror

```
$ git remote add gitlabMirror https://gitlab.com/selene.cash/selene-wallet.git
# Replace the merge request number & choose a branch name
$ git fetch gitlabMirror merge-requests/1111111/head:MY_NEW_BRANCH
# Now that branch is local and can be merged as usual
$ git merge MY_NEW_BRANCH
```

### Auto-translations

Manually managing translations got super tiresome and unwieldy with so many languages, so it has been automated.

```
# Use a valid API key
$ GOOGLE_TRANSLATE_API_KEY="XXXXXXXXX" node ./automation/addLanguages.js
# Please read below about the cost of API credits!!
```

Translation files are colocated with the file needing the translation strings. The script scans the entire `src` folder for `.js`/`.jsx` files containing `const translations = {`. For every found file, it finds leaf-level objects containing an `en` key (e.g. `{ en: "Hello" }`), translates into every supported language (skipping any already present), and overwrites the original file with values sorted alphabetically by language key.

Brand names (Bitcoin Cash, Selene, BCH, PIN, CashTokens, etc.) are automatically protected from translation via placeholder substitution. Common HTML entities (`&#39;`, `&quot;`, etc.) are auto-decoded in translated output.

NOTE: Translation string values should not include `:` as it can confuse the parser. Prefer `-` instead.

Translations use the Google Cloud Translation API. It isn't super expensive, but it does cost money per translation. The script skips existing translations and only fills in missing ones, but if you're adding new text please don't run up the bill by running it unnecessarily. Decide on the English versions as part of concluding your feature merge request, prepare the translation files, then run the script once to fill everything out.

There is also an export script so you can give a .txt file to somebody willing to review and update translations in a specific language `node automation/exportTranslations.js es`, which can be reimported using the import script (provide pathname to the updated file).
